# lattpy 0.3.0

NOTE: This project is still under development!

`lattpy` is a python package for modeling bravais lattices and constructing (finite) lattice structures.

Installation
------------

Download package and install via pip
````commandline
pip install -e <folder path>
````
or the setup.py script
````commandline
python setup.py install
````


Usage
=====

Before accessing the attributes of the `Lattice`-model the lattice has to be configured

Configuration
-------------

A new instance of a lattice model is initialized using the unit-vectors of the Bravais lattice.
After the initialization the atoms of the unit-cell need to be added. To finish the configuration
the number of distances in the lattice need to be set. This computes the nearest distances between
all atoms of the unit-cells. If only the nearest distance is computed the lattice will be set to 
nearest neighbours.
````python
import numpy as np
from lattpy import Lattice

latt = Lattice(np.eye(2))       # Construct a Bravais lattice with square unit-vectors
latt.add_atom(pos=[0.0, 0.0])   # Add an Atom to the unit cell of the lattice
latt.calculate_distances(1)     # Set the maximum number of distances in the configuration.
````

To speed up the configuration prefabs of common lattices are included. The previous lattice for example
can also be constructed as following:
````python
from lattpy import simple_square

latt = simple_square(a=1.0, neighbours=1)  # Initializes a square lattice with one atom in the unit-cell
````

So far only the lattice structure has been configured. To actually construct a (finite) model of the lattice
the model has to be built:
````python
latt.build(shape=(5, 3))
````
This will compute the indices and neighbours of all sites in the given shape and store the data.
By default the lattice is built in real-space, meaning the shape parameter passed to the `build`-method is
interpreted as a rectangle in real space. Alternatively the lattice can be built in the unit-vector-space:
````python
latt.build(shape=(5, 3), inbound=False)
````

After building the lattice periodic boundary conditions can be set along one or multiple axes:
````python
latt.set_periodic(axis=0)
````

To view the built lattice the `plot`-method can be used:
````python
from lattpy import simple_square

latt = simple_square(a=1.0, neighbours=1)
latt.build((5, 3))
latt.plot()
````

General lattice attributes
--------------------------

After configuring the lattice the attributes are available. 
Even without building a (finite) lattice structure all attributes can be computed on the fly for a given lattice vector, 
consisting of the translation vector `n` and the atom index `alpha`. For computing the (translated) atom positions 
the `get_position` method is used. Also, the neighbours and the vectors to these neighbours can be calculated. 
The `dist_idx`-parameter specifies the distance of the neighbours (0 for nearest neighbours, 1 for next nearest neighbours, ...):
````python
from lattpy import simple_square

latt = simple_square() 

# Get position of atom alpha=0 in the translated unit-cell
positions = latt.get_position(n=[0, 0], alpha=0)

# Get lattice-indices of the nearest neighbours of atom alpha=0 in the translated unit-cell
neighbour_indices = latt.get_neighbours(n=[0, 0], alpha=0, distidx=0)

# Get vectors to the nearest neighbours of atom alpha=0 in the translated unit-cell  
neighbour_vectors = latt.get_neighbour_vectors(alpha=0, distidx=0)
````

Also, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be computed
````python
rvecs = latt.reciprocal_vectors()
````

or used to construct the reciprocal lattice:
````python
rlatt = latt.reciprocal_lattice()
````


Finite lattice data
-------------------

If the lattice has been built the needed data is cached. The lattice sites of the structure then can be 
accessed by a simple index `i`. The syntax is the same as before, just without the `get_` prefix:
````python
from lattpy import simple_square

latt = simple_square()
latt.build((5, 2))
idx = 2

# Get position of the atom with index i=2
positions = latt.position(idx)

# Get the atom indices of the nearest neighbours of the atom with index i=2
neighbour_indices = latt.neighbours(idx, distidx=0)

# the nearest neighbours can also be found by calling (equivalent to dist_idx=0)
neighbour_indices = latt.nearest_neighbours(idx)

````




Examples
========

Using the (built) lattice model it is easy to construct the (kinetic) Hamiltonian of a non-interacting model:

````python
import numpy as np
from lattpy import simple_chain

# Initializes a 1D lattice chain with a length of 5 atoms.
latt = simple_chain(a=1.0)
latt.build(shape=5, inbound=False)
n = latt.num_sites

# Construct the non-interacting (kinetic) Hamiltonian-matrix
eps, t = 0., 1.
ham = np.zeros((n, n))
for i in range(n):
    ham[i, i] = eps
    for j in latt.nearest_neighbours(i):
        ham[i, j] = t
````
This will create the Hamiltonian-matrix:
````
[[0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]]
````

If periodic boundary conditions are set (along axis 0) the matrix will be:
````
[[0. 1. 0. 0. 1.]
 [1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 1.]
 [1. 0. 0. 1. 0.]]
````
